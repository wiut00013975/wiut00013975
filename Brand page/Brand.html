                  <strong>
                       At the dawn of the automotive industry, new brands of motor vehicles often carried the names of their creators.
                       However, the Chevrolet brand was different. 
                       The Swiss man Louis Joseph Chevrolet (1878-1941) was a famous racer and mechanic, but he was never the owner of the company that bore his name.
                  </strong>                
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Louis Chevrolet was one of the seven children of a poor watchmaker in the Swiss town of La Chaux-de-Fonds.
                    When he was 10 years old, his family moved to France to find the best share, where the boy graduated from high school, and then got a job at the car company Mors.
                    Here, he was carried away by cars for life and became the official motor-car driver of this company.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Having received good skills in automotive and sports, he went to Canada, and in 1900 - to the United States of America.
                    Here he started his activity as a representative of the French car factory De Dion Bouton in America. 
                    However, the race occupied him more than the car business.

                    For five consecutive years, Louis participated in all local competitions, until in 1905 he did not have the right to compete in the cup of the American millionaire Vanderbilt Cup. 
                    A brave and determined racer attracted the attention of America's industrial aces. Among them was William Durant (William Durant), who gathered by then several different car companies under the signboard of General Motors. In 1909, Durant invited Louis Chevrolet to become a branded racer Buick. 
                    Then the star of Louis Chevrolet began to rise at an unprecedented speed. 
                    In 1909, he scored three important victories at once and took the 11th place in the Vanderbilt Cup. 
                    Prior to World War I, he was part of the best race car race in America.

                    The birth of Chevrolet Motor Cars in Detroit in 1911 was not for the best period in the existence of General Motors. 
                    Its head - William Durand - put the company on the verge of bankruptcy, thoughtlessly buying up unprofitable car companies. 
                    In addition, he began to lose money on stock speculation with securities, which forced him to bow to the bankers. 
                    Those promised to invest in General Motors $ 15 million, but with one condition - William Durant must leave the post of its head. 
                    However, he did not give up hope to take the reins of the company in his own hands.

                <p>
                   Enterprising Durant decided to do business on behalf of the famous athlete. 
                   In 1911, he suggested that Louis temporarily leave the race and start manufacturing his own car, and he agreed to this. 
                   The project of the new car was developed by specialists of General Motors, Duran invested a lot of money into the project, and Chevrolet gave the car its name, already well known to the majority of Americans. 
                   It was the guarantee of future success. So November 3, 1911 was born one of the most famous automobile brands - Chevrolet.

                    The company's logo appeared a little later - in 1914. 
                    The legend says that the famous "cross" or, as it is also called, "bow tie", was part of the wallpaper of the Parisian hotel, in which young Duran stopped as far back as 1908. 
                    After saving a piece of wallpaper in the wallet as a souvenir, he brought him to America and, showing his friends, explained: 
                    "This should be the emblem of the car - it will help him move to infinity."
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And indeed, the Chevrolet emblem became one of the most untwisted and powerful symbols in the advertising business. 
                    For the years of its existence, the brand has gained the love of buyers and the recognition of specialists, and its cars have not just gone down in history - they are in themselves a story, alive and still a symbol of America and the American automobile industry.
